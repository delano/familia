### Security

- Hardened external identifier derivation with provenance validation. ExternalIdentifier now validates that objid values come from the ObjectIdentifier feature before deriving external identifiers, preventing derivation from potentially malicious or unvalidated objid values while maintaining deterministic behavior for legitimate use cases.

### Changed

- ObjectIdentifier feature now tracks which generator (uuid_v7, uuid_v4, hex, or custom) was used for each objid to provide provenance information for security-sensitive operations.
- Updated external identifier derivation to normalize objid format based on the known generator type, eliminating format ambiguity between UUID and hex formats.

### AI Assistance

- Security analysis of external identifier derivation and hardened design approach was discussed and developed with AI assistance, including provenance tracking, validation logic, format normalization, and comprehensive test updates.
