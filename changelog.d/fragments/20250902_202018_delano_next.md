### Added

- **Enhanced Feature System**: Introduced a hierarchical feature system with ancestry chain traversal for model-specific feature registration. This enables better organization, standardized naming, and automatic loading of project-specific features via the new `Familia::Features::Autoloader` module.
- **Improved SafeDump DSL**: Replaced the internal `@safe_dump_fields` implementation with a cleaner, more robust DSL using `safe_dump_field` and `safe_dump_fields` methods.
- Added `generate_short_id` and `shorten_securely` utility methods for creating short, secure identifiers, adapted from `OT::Utils::SecureNumbers`.
- For a detailed guide on migrating to the new feature system, see `docs/migration/v2.0.0-pre11.md`.

### TODO
- external ID and object id features to add field :extid, field :objid


### Changed

- External identifier now raises an `ExternalIdentifierError` if the model does not have an objid field. Previously: returned nil. In practice this should never happen, since the external_identifier feature declares its dependency on object_identifier.

### Fixed

- Fixed external identifier generation returning all zeros for UUID-based objids. The `shorten_to_external_id` method now correctly handles both 256-bit secure identifiers and 128-bit UUIDs by detecting input length and applying appropriate bit truncation only when needed.

### Security

- Improved input validation in `shorten_to_external_id` method by replacing insecure character count checking with proper bit length calculation and explicit validation. Invalid inputs now raise clear error messages instead of being silently processed incorrectly.
