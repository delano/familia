### Added

- Added the `Familia::VerifiableIdentifier` module to create and verify identifiers with an embedded HMAC signature. This allows an application to stateless-ly confirm that an identifier was generated by itself, preventing forged IDs from malicious sources.

### Documentation

- Added detailed YARD documentation for `VerifiableIdentifier`, explaining how to securely generate and manage the required `VERIFIABLE_ID_HMAC_SECRET` key.
