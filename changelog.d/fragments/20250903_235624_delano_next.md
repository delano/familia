### Added

- **Scoped VerifiableIdentifier**: Added `scope` parameter to `generate_verifiable_id()` and `verified_identifier?()` methods, enabling cryptographically isolated identifier namespaces for multi-tenant, multi-domain, or multi-environment applications while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing code.

### AI Assistance

- Implementation of scoped verifiable identifiers was developed with AI assistance to ensure cryptographic security properties and comprehensive test coverage.
