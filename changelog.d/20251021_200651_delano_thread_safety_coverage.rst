Fixed
-----

- **Thread Safety Test Suite**: Strengthened test assertions to properly verify thread safety invariants rather than just checking thread completion. Tests now use multi-property assertions (checking for nil corruption, correctness, and completeness) that honestly expose race conditions. Test suite status updated from misleading **56/56 all passing** to honest **61/63 passing (2 failing)**. The 2 failures correctly detect a real race condition in connection chain lazy initialization at ``lib/familia/connection.rb:95`` which lacks Mutex protection and creates multiple chain instances under concurrent access instead of maintaining singleton property.

Added
-----

- **Advanced Testing Patterns**: Documented 5 reusable concurrency testing patterns in thread safety README: Structure Validation, Concurrent Clearing, Mixed Operation Types, Rapid Sequential Calls, and Type/Method Validation. These patterns enable effective thread safety testing across any concurrent code.

- **Middleware Thread Safety Tests**: Restored comprehensive middleware thread safety test file (was .txt, now .rb) with sophisticated tests covering concurrent append operations, mixed operations, rapid sequential calls, concurrent clearing, and structure preservation under concurrency.

- **Pipeline Routing Investigation**: Created 7 diagnostic testcases in ``try/investigation/pipeline_routing/`` to investigate suspected middleware routing issue. Investigation revealed single-command pipelines don't have ' | ' separator (expected Array#join behavior), confirming no routing bug exists. Full analysis documented in ``CONCLUSION.md``.

Changed
-------

- **Test Suite Cleanup**: Removed 2 tests with incorrect expectations after investigation proved they were testing wrong assumptions rather than actual bugs: (1) sample_rate counter test at ``middleware_thread_safety_try.rb:113`` - sample_rate intentionally controls logging output, not command capture; (2) pipeline command logging test at ``middleware_thread_safety_try.rb:224`` - single-command pipelines correctly don't have ' | ' separator per Array#join behavior.

AI Assistance
-------------

- Claude Code assisted with:

  - Analyzing PR feedback about weak test assertions and evaluating each failure as potential production bug
  - Investigating git history to understand test evolution
  - Applying multi-property assertion patterns from middleware tests to connection chain tests
  - Extracting and documenting reusable testing patterns
  - Working with backend-dev agent to create isolated pipeline routing diagnostic testcases
  - Systematically investigating each test failure to distinguish real bugs from test assumption errors
  - Creating comprehensive documentation of test suite status, known failures, and investigation findings

  This work involved extensive git archaeology, pattern recognition across test files, systematic debugging using isolated testcases, collaboration with specialized agents, and rigorous analysis to provide honest feedback about thread safety status.
