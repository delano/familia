### Security
- Improved the security of external identifiers (`extid`) by using the internal object identifier (`objid`) as a seed for a new random value, rather than deriving the `extid` directly. This prevents potential information leakage from the internal `objid`.

### Changed
- Refactored identifier generation methods for clarity and consistency. Method `generate_objid` is now `generate_object_identifier`, and `generate_external_identifier` is now `derive_external_identifier` to reflect its deterministic nature.

### Removed
- Removed the `generate_extid` class method, which was less secure than the instance-level derivation logic.
