Added
-----
- Add ``:through`` option to ``participates_in`` for join model support.
  Enables storing additional attributes (role, permissions, metadata) on
  participation relationships via an intermediate model. The through model
  uses deterministic keys and supports idempotent operations - adding an
  existing participant updates rather than duplicates.

Documentation
-------------
- Add YARD documentation for the ``:through`` parameter on both
  ``participates_in`` and ``class_participates_in`` methods.

Security
--------
- Add validation for through model attributes to prevent arbitrary method
  invocation. Only fields defined on the through model schema can be set
  via the ``through_attrs`` parameter.

AI Assistance
-------------
- Implementation design and code review assistance provided by Claude.
  Security hardening for attribute validation added based on Qodo review.
