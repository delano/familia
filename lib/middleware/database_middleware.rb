# DatabaseLogger is RedisClient middleware.
#
# This middleware addresses the need for detailed Database command logging, which
# was removed from the redis-rb gem due to performance concerns. However, in
# many development and debugging scenarios, the ability to log Database commands
# can be invaluable.
#
# @example Enable Database command logging
#   DatabaseLogger.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
#   RedisClient.register(DatabaseLogger)
#
# @see https://github.com/redis-rb/redis-client?tab=readme-ov-file#instrumentation-and-middlewares
#
# @note While there were concerns about the performance impact of logging in
#   the redis-rb gem, this middleware is designed to be optional and can be
#   easily enabled or disabled as needed. The performance impact is minimal
#   when logging is disabled, and the benefits during development and debugging
#   often outweigh the slight performance cost when enabled.
module DatabaseLogger
  @logger = nil

  class << self
    # Gets/sets the logger instance used by DatabaseLogger.
    # @return [Logger, nil] The current logger instance or nil if not set.
    attr_accessor :logger
  end

  # Logs the Database command and its execution time.
  #
  # This method is called for each Database command when the middleware is active.
  # It logs the command and its execution time only if a logger is set.
  #
  # @param command [Array] The Database command and its arguments.
  # @param _config [Hash] The configuration options for the Redis
  #   connection.
  # @return [Object] The result of the Database command execution.
  #
  # @note The performance impact of this logging is negligible when no logger
  #   is set, as it quickly returns control to the Database client. When a logger
  #   is set, the minimal overhead is often offset by the valuable insights
  #   gained during development and debugging.

# DatabaseCommandCounter is RedisClient middleware.
#
# This middleware counts the number of Database commands executed. It can be
