# DatabaseCommandCounter is RedisClient middleware for counting commands.
#
# This middleware counts the number of Redis commands executed. It can be
# useful for performance monitoring and debugging, allowing you to track
# the volume of Redis operations in your application.
#
# ## Middleware Chaining
#
# This middleware works correctly alongside DatabaseLogger because it uses
# `super` to properly chain method calls. See {DatabaseLogger} for detailed
# explanation of middleware chaining mechanics.
#
# @example Enable Redis command counting
#   DatabaseCommandCounter.reset
#   RedisClient.register(DatabaseCommandCounter)
#
# @example Use with DatabaseLogger
#   RedisClient.register(DatabaseLogger)
#   RedisClient.register(DatabaseCommandCounter)
#   # Both middlewares execute correctly in sequence
#
# @see https://github.com/redis-rb/redis-client?tab=readme-ov-file#instrumentation-and-middlewares
# @see DatabaseLogger For middleware chain architecture details
#

  # We skip SELECT because the frequency depends on connection architecture:
  # - Connection-per-database: Only one SELECT when connection is made
  # - Provider/thread-local: Could theoretically double statement count
