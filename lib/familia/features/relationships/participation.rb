    module Relationships
      # Participation module for participates_in relationships using Valkey/Redis collections
      # Provides multi-presence support where objects can exist in multiple collections
      # Integrates both tracking and membership functionality into a single API
      #
      # === Architecture Overview ===
      # This module is organized into clear, separate concerns:
      #
      # 1. CollectionOperations: Shared helpers for all collection manipulation
      # 2. ParticipantMethods: Methods added to the class calling participates_in
      # 3. TargetMethods: Methods added to the target class specified in participates_in
      #
      # This separation makes it crystal clear what methods are added to which class.
      #
      # === Visual Example ===
      # When Domain calls: participates_in Customer, :domains
      #
      # PARTICIPANT (Domain) gets:
      # - domain.in_customer_domains?(customer)
      # - domain.add_to_customer_domains(customer)
      # - domain.remove_from_customer_domains(customer)
      #
      # TARGET (Customer) gets:
      # - customer.domains
      # - customer.add_domain(domain)
      # - customer.remove_domain(domain)
      # - customer.add_domains([...])
      #
      module Participation
        using Familia::Refinements::StylizeWords

        # Hook called when module is included in a class.
        #
        # Extends the host class with ModelClassMethods for relationship definitions
        # and includes ModelInstanceMethods for instance-level operations.
        #
        # @param base [Class] The class including this module
        def self.included(base)
          base.extend ModelClassMethods

        end

        # Class methods for defining participation relationships.
        #
        # These methods are available on any class that includes the Participation module,
        # allowing definition of both instance-level and class-level participation relationships.
        module ModelClassMethods
          # Define a class-level participation collection where all instances automatically participate.
          #
          # Class-level participation creates a global collection containing all instances of the class,
          # with automatic management of membership based on object lifecycle events. This is useful
          # for maintaining global indexes, leaderboards, or categorical groupings.
          #
          # The collection is created at the class level (e.g., User.all_users) rather than on
          # individual instances, providing a centralized view of all objects matching the criteria.
          #
          # === Generated Methods
          #
          # ==== On the Class (Target Methods)

          #   user.in_class_all_users?    # true if user is in collection
          #
          # @example Dynamic scoring based on status
          #   class Customer < Familia::Horreum

          #
          # This method creates a bidirectional relationship where instances of the calling class
          # (participants) can join collections owned by instances of the target class. This enables
          # flexible multi-membership scenarios where objects can belong to multiple collections
          # simultaneously with different scoring and management strategies.
          #
          # The relationship automatically handles reverse index tracking, allowing efficient
          # lookup of all collections a participant belongs to via the +current_participations+ method.
          #
          # === Generated Methods
          #

          # - +target.collection_name+ - Access the collection DataType
          # - +target.add_participant_class_name(participant)+ - Add participant to collection
          # - +target.remove_participant_class_name(participant)+ - Remove participant from collection
          # - +target.add_participant_class_names([participants])+ - Bulk add multiple participants
          #
          # ==== On Participant Class (if bidirectional)
          # - +participant.in_target_collection_name?(target)+ - Check membership in target's collection
          # - +participant.add_to_target_collection_name(target)+ - Add self to target's collection
          # - +participant.remove_from_target_collection_name(target)+ - Remove self from target's collection

          # === Reverse Index Tracking
          #
          # Automatically creates a +:participations+ set field on the participant class to track
          # all collections the instance belongs to. This enables efficient membership queries
          # and cleanup operations without scanning all possible collections.
          #
          # @param target_class [Class, Symbol, String] The class that owns the collection. Can be:
          #   - +Class+ object (e.g., +Customer+)
          #   - +Symbol+ referencing class name (e.g., +:customer+, +:Customer+)
          #   - +String+ class name (e.g., +"Customer"+)

          #   - +:ignore+: Leave in collections when destroyed
          # @param type [Symbol] Valkey/Redis collection type:
          #   - +:sorted_set+: Ordered by score, allows duplicates with different scores (default)
          #   - +:set+: Unordered unique membership
          #   - +:list+: Ordered sequence, allows duplicates
          # @param bidirectional [Boolean] Whether to generate convenience methods on participant class (default: +true+)

          # behavior for edge cases and error conditions.
          #
          # The calculated score determines the object's position within sorted collections and can be
          # dynamically recalculated as object state changes, enabling responsive collection ordering
          # based on real-time business logic.
          #
          # === Scoring Strategies
          #
          # [Symbol] Field name or method name - calls +send(symbol)+ on the instance
          #   * +:priority_level+ - Uses value of priority_level field
          #   * +:created_at+ - Uses timestamp for chronological ordering
          #   * +:calculate_importance+ - Calls custom method for complex logic
          #
          # [Proc] Dynamic calculation executed in instance context using +instance_exec+
          #   * +-> { skill_level * experience_years }+ - Combines multiple fields
          #   * +-> { active? ? 100 : 0 }+ - Conditional scoring based on state
          #   * +-> { Rails.cache.fetch("score:#{id}") { expensive_calculation } }+ - Cached computations
          #
          # [Numeric] Static score applied uniformly to all instances
          #   * +50.0+ - All instances get same floating-point score
          #   * +100+ - All instances get same integer score (converted to float)
          #
          # [nil] Uses +current_score+ method as fallback if available
          #
          # === Performance Considerations
          #
          # - Score calculations are performed on-demand during collection operations
          # - Proc-based calculations should be efficient as they may be called frequently
          # - Consider caching expensive calculations within the Proc itself
          # - Static numeric scores have no performance overhead
          #
          # === Thread Safety
          #
          # Score calculations should be idempotent and thread-safe since they may be
          # called concurrently during collection updates. Avoid modifying instance state
          # within scoring Procs.
          #
          # @param target_class [Class, Symbol, String] The target class containing the collection
          # @param collection_name [Symbol] The collection name within the target class
          # @return [Float] Calculated score for sorted set positioning, falls back to current_score
          #
          # @example Field-based scoring
          #   class Task < Familia::Horreum
          #     field :priority  # 1=low, 5=high
          #     participates_in Project, :tasks, score: :priority
