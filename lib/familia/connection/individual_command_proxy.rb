module Familia
  module Connection
    # Proxy class that executes Redis commands individually instead of in a transaction
    #
    # This class intercepts Redis method calls and executes them immediately against
    # the underlying connection, collecting results as if they were part of a transaction.
    # Used as a fallback when transaction mode is unavailable but graceful degradation
    # is preferred over raising an error.
    #
    # @example Usage in transaction fallback
    #   conn = dbclient
    #   proxy = IndividualCommandProxy.new(conn)
    #
    #   proxy.set('key1', 'value1')  # Executes immediately
    #   proxy.incr('counter')        # Executes immediately
    #   proxy.get('key1')           # Executes immediately
    #
    #   results = proxy.collected_results  # => ["OK", 1, "value1"]
