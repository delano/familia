### Added

- Complete API redesign for clarity and modern Ruby conventions
- Valkey compatibility alongside traditional Redis support
- Ruby 3.4+ modernization with fiber and thread safety improvements
- Connection pooling foundation with provider pattern architecture

### Changed

- `Familia::Base` replaced by `Familia::Horreum` as the primary base class
