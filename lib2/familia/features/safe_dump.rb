module Familia::Features
  # SafeDump is a mixin that allows models to define a list of fields that are
  # safe to dump. This is useful for serializing objects to JSON or other
  # formats where you want to ensure that only certain fields are exposed.
  #
  # To use SafeDump, include it in your model and define a list of fields that
  # are safe to dump. The fields can be either symbols or hashes. If a field is
  # a symbol, the method with the same name will be called on the object to
  # retrieve the value. If the field is a hash, the key is the field name and
  # the value is a lambda that will be called with the object as an argument.
  # the hash syntax allows you to:
  #   * define a field name that is different from the method name
  #   * define a field that requires some computation on-the-fly
  #   * define a field that is not a method on the object
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   @safe_dump_fields = [
  #     :objid,
  #     :updated,
  #     :created,
  #     { :active => ->(obj) { obj.active? } }
  #   ]
  #
  # Internally, all fields are normalized to the hash syntax and store in
  # @safe_dump_field_map. `SafeDump.safe_dump_fields` returns only the list
  # of symbols in the order they were defined. From the example above, it would
  # return `[:objid, :updated, :created, :active]`.
